## **INTRODUCTION**
Indoor positioning is still a developing field and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons can be the key points of this rising technology. GPS is useful for outdoor locations but we need other methods for indoor positioning. Bluetooth technology can answer to these rising needs on indoor positioning but there are limitations. These limitations are from the variations of signal strengths, objects blocking signals, short distance ranges of Bluetooth signals. These are some of the limitations which makes indoor positioning more challenging.

Nonetheless, there are solutions that improves the accuracy of positioning such as triangulation. BLE beacons can be considered as reference points to track an asset (mostly a 
mobile device). More the reference points, better the position accuracy of an asset. In this project, a reverse engineering method will be discussed. Which is “Can we apply the same principle to track and find locations of beacons using our mobile devices?”.
